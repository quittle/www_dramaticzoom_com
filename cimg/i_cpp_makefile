#This makefile is to create an image processing program
#The output is an executable called 'i'

#default produces a file with default compiler optimizations
#0 produces a file with no optimizations
#1 produces a file with some optimizations
#2 produces a file with a lot of optimizations
#3 produces a file with as many optimizations as it can
#3Plus produces a file with as many optimizations as it can and strips the executable of symbols. Shrinking it as much as possible

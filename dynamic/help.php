		<ul>
			<li>
				<p class="q">
					What is a zoomograph?
				</p>
				<p class="a">
					A zoomograph is a term for the result of your uploaded image.  It is a piece of digital art, involving zooming in on an image to a specific focus point.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="q">
					I lost my zoomograph, how can I find it?
				</p>
				<p class="a">
					If you made an account, you click on "Manage Account" on the left to view the zoomographs you made with that account.  If you do not have an account or the zoomographs are made while you are not logged in, the links will not be maintained in a list for you as they are kept anonymous.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="q">
					Help! My account has been suddenly deleted!
				</p>
				<p class="a">
					If you registered your account with a fake email address or one you do not have access to or fail to respond the account registration email, your account will be automatically deleted after 3 days.  Once deleted, it is impossible to restore your account.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="q">
					What types of files does Dramatic Zoom support?
				</p>
				<p class="a">
					You can upload jpgs, pngs, gifs, and bmps.  All other image types are incompatible.<br />
					Images' filename extensions are not necessary, so URLs for images from the web with odd filenames work just fine.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="q">
					What is the largest image I can upload?
				</p>
				<p class="a">
					Dramatic Zoom allows uploads of files up to 1 megabyte large.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="q">
					I uploaded my image, but can&apos;t see the zoomography. (Broken image)
				</p>
				<p class="a">
					If the image upload succeeded and you were taken to your zoomography, but it does not appear, try refreshing the page.  If it still does not appear, something might have gone wrong and you may need to create a new zoomograph, sorry.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="q">
					I tried uploading the image but I get strange, white error page and am redirected back to the homepage.
				</p>
				<p class="a">
					There are a number of things that may be causing it.  At the bottom of the text should be an error message that may help identify your trouble.  If you uploaded an image, make sure it was a valid, uncorrupted image file.  If the image was chosen via URL, make sure you copied only the URL without any other characters.  Make sure the image is a valid size.  If the image is only available once you have signed into a site, it might not be accessible to Dramatic Zoom. Try downloading it by right-clicking and selecting "Save image as..", then uploading the image from your computer.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="q">
					I like Dramatic Zoom, but that music is really annoying. Can I do anything about it?
				</p>
				<p class="a">
					Hover in the top, right corner of a zoomagraph and click &quot;Disable Sound&quot; to turn off zoomograph sounds on that computer.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="q">
					When I view mine or others zoomographies, I can not hear anything.
				</p>
				<p class="a">
					First check that sound button in the top, right corner of all zoomographs says &quot;Disable Sound&quot; which means it is currently enabled.  If it still does not work, make sure your computer volume is turned up and that any external speakers are turned on with the volume turned up.  The only other possibility is that your browser is asking for permission to let a 3rd-party application run, such as Windows Media Player.  Click to always allow access.
				</p>

				<p class="q">
					Why Dramatic Zoom?
				</p>
				<p class="a">
					It occurred to me one day, &quot;why can't all images be viewed like Dramatic Chipmunk?&quot;<br />So I fixed it.  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y73sPHKxw">YouTube Link</a>
